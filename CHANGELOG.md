### API Changes

- `Switch` and `TextField` no longer autogenerate an aria-labelledby attribute for their input fields. They can be supplied via the labelId prop. This change was needed to fix server-side rendering hydration errors on the client. uuid was also removed from dependencies, so expect a slightly smaller bundle size.

### Build Changes

For versions `1.2.3` (inclusive) and prior, the distributions were incorrect.

- The commonjs `dist/index.js` file had module ES module import/export syntax.
- The commonjs source files had their css inlined (poor for performance and causes bundle size bloat).
- The module build couldn't be tree-shaken since `{sideEffects: false}` was not set in package.json.
- Both builds missed other opportunities for reducing bundle size, like removing prop types.
