This is a collection of React components that implement Google's [material design specification](https://material.io/guidelines). The goals of this project include:

- Minimal to zero configuration to consume components through carefully-crafted, lightweight implementations.
- Be fit for enterprise consumption: components are to be performant, accessible, unit tested, cross-browser supported, support server-side rendering, etc.


Examples
--------

See our [material-react-components-examples](https://github.com/collegepulse/material-react-components-examples) repo for examples of small projects that demonstrate how to import the ES5 or ES6 components with Webpack.

[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) has provided us with the tools and infrastructure necessary to build a high quality component library by testing our components on an array of browsers. Thank you.

[material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui) has been an influence in some of our component implementations. We are appreciative of the effort and contributions happening over there.
