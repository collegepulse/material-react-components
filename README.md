material-react-components
=========================

This is a collection of React components that implement Google's [material design specification](https://material.io/guidelines). The goals of this project include:

- Minimal to zero configuration to consume components through carefully-crafted, lightweight implementations.
- Be fit for enterprise consumption: components are to be performant, accessible, unit tested, cross-browser supported, etc.

Acknowlegements
---------------

In some places, implementations have been influenced by [material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui). We are appreciative of the effort and contributions happening over there.
